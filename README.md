# Moore's Law
This is a notebook, demonstrating a simple analysis of transistor data with the motive to prove Moore's Law.<br>
<br>Mooreâ€™s law, a prediction made by American engineer Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of transistors per silicon chip doubles every year.<br>
This trend can be seen when there is an exponential growth trend.<br><br>
